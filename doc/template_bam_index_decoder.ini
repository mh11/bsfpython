[bsf.analyses.illumina_to_bam_tools.BamIndexDecoder]

# (Meaningful) Project Name (mandatory)
#
# In the context of BamIndexDecoder conversion, the project name is set to the
# flow cell identifier, which is a concatenation of the experiment name and
# the flow cell barcode. It is also the name of the sub-directory in the
# central sequence store, the sequences directory obtained from
# bsf.Default.absolute_sequences.

project_name =

# Analysis Input and Output Directories (optional)
#
# Analysis input and output directories can override standard paths
# from bsf.Configuration. Both, user and variable expansion gets
# applied. If, at that point, the path is still relative, default
# directory paths from bsf.Default get prepended. These
# options can therefore remain empty in typical cases and the output
# directory will be created in the standard location from the project
# name.
#
# input_directory =
# output_directory =

# Debug Level (optional)
#
# A level of extra information can be set via an integer,
# the higher, the more verbose.
#
# Defaults to 0.
#
# debug = 0

# Hash-based algortithm (optional)
#
# Use a hash-based demultiplexing algorithm, which is a BSF-specific extension to the BamIndexDecoder code.
#
# Defaults to false.
#
# hash_algorithm =

# Library Annotation File (optional)
#
# A library annotation file specifies in comma-separated value format
# information required for de-multiplexing of BAM files created with
# Illumina2bam.
#
# Column names:
#   lane
#   barcode_sequence_1
#   barcode_sequence_2
#   sample_name
#   library_name
#
# Defaults to 'project_name'_libraries.csv, in the working directory,
# if not explicitly specified.
#
# library_path =

# Sequences Directory File Path (optional)
#
# The directory, in which the project-specific sequences directory with archive BAM files will be created.
#
# Defaults to the value set in bsf.Default.absolute_sequences().
#
# sequences_directory =

# Samples Directory File Path (optional)
#
# The directory, in which the project-specific samples directory with demultiplexed BAM files will be created.
#
# Defaults to the value set in bsf.Default.absolute_samples().
#
# samples_directory =

# Directory access mode permission bits (optional)
#
# A comma separated list of directory access mode permisison bit names according to the Python stat module.
#
# Defaults to an undefined value which implies no change.
#
# mode_directory = S_IRUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IROTH

# File access mode permission bits (optional)
#
# A comma separated list of file access mode permisison bit names according to the Python stat module.
#
# Defaults to an undefined value which implies no change.
#
# mode_file = S_IRUSR, S_IXUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IXGRP, S_IROTH, S_IXOTH

# Illumina2bam Java Class Path (optional)
#
# The class path to the Java Archive (JAR) files for the Illumina2bam package.
#
# Defaults to the value in bsf.Default.classpath_illumina2bam.
#
# classpath_illumina2bam =

# Picard Java Class Path (optional)
#
# The class path to the Java Archive (JAR) files for the Picard package.
#
# Defaults to the value in bsf.Default.classpath_picard.
#
# classpath_picard =

# Lanes (optional)
#
# The number of lanes of the flow cell, required for validating the library annotation sheet.
#
# Defaults to 8.
#
# lanes =

# Force Processing (optional)
#
# Force processing even if validation of the library annotation sheet fails.
#
# Defaults to false.
#
# force =
