# (Meaningful) Project Name (mandatory)

# The project name also defines the project directory name under the
# standard path obtained from bsf.standards.StandardFilePath.get_projects(absolute=True).

# Analysis Input and Output Directories (optional)
#
# Analysis input and output directories can override standard paths
# from bsf.Configuration. Both, user and variable expansion gets
# applied. If, at that point, the path is still relative, default
# directory paths from bsf.standards.StandardFilePath get prepended. These
# options can therefore remain empty in typical cases and the output
# directory will be created in the standard location from the project
# name.
#
# input_directory =
# output_directory =

# Debug Level (optional)
#
# A level of extra information can be set via an integer,
# the higher, the more verbose.
#
# Defaults to 0.

# The Sample Annotation Sheet (SAS) specifies a hierarchy of BSF
# ProcessedRunFolder, BSF Project, BSF Sample, BSF PairedReads and BSF
# Reads objects. Additionally, the file type (i.e. 'CASAVA' or
# 'External') can be specified for automatic discovery of objects in
# CASAVA-processed run folders.

# A [bsf.analysis.Stage] section is usually read from the central configuration file.
# Please see the doc/template_bsfpython.ini file for a descripton of
