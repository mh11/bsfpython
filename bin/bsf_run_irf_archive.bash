#! /bin/bash
#
# BSF GNU Bourne-Again (Bash) script to pack an Illumina Run Folder
# for tape archiving.
#
#  1. Check if the Illumina Run has finished by testing for an
#     RTAComplete.txt file.
#  2. Check if an archive process is already running by testing for an
#     archive directory.
#  3. Create an archive directory.
#  4. Size the native Illumina Run Folder via the du utility.
#  5. Reset the file permissions for all directories via the find utility.
#  6. Reset the file permissions for all regular files via the find utility.
#  7. Run the GNU tar utility over each Data/Intensities/L00[1-8] directory,
#     before deleting the directory.
#  8. Run the GNU tar utility over the remaining Data/Intensities directory,
#     before deleting the Intensities directory.
#  9. Run the GNU tar utility over the remaining Illumina Run folder.
# 10. Record the archive file sizes via the ls utility.
#
# Usage: bsf_run_irf_archive.bash illumina_run_folder [output_directory] [force]
#
#   illumina_run_folder: Path to the Illumina Run Folder
#
#   output_directory: Path to the output directory, in which an archive
#                     directory will be created. If not specified, defaults
#                     to the current working directory.
#
#   force: Forces archiving of an incomplete Illumina Run Folder
#          (RTAComplete.txt is missing) or a restart of archiving after an
#          archive directory has already been created.
