# (Meaningful) Project Name (mandatory)
#
# The project name also defines the project directory name under the
# standard path obtained from bsf.standards.FilePath.get_projects(absolute=True).

project_name =

# Analysis Input and Output Directories (optional)
#
# Analysis input and output directories can override standard paths
# from bsf.Configuration. Both, user and variable expansion gets
# applied. If, at that point, the path is still relative, default
# directory paths from bsf.standards.FilePath get prepended. These
# options can therefore remain empty in typical cases and the output
# directory will be created in the standard location from the project
# name.
#
# input_directory =
# output_directory =

# Debug Level (optional)
#
# A level of extra information can be set via an integer,
# the higher, the more verbose.
#
# Defaults to 0.
#
# debug = 0

# Transcriptome Version (mandatory)
#
# The transcriptome version

transcriptome_version =

# Transcriptome Index Path (optional)
#
# Defaults to the transcriptome-specific sub-directory in the
# 'kallisto' option of the [indices] configuration section and a
# transcriptome_version.idx file.
#
# transcriptome_index_path =

# Fragment Length Value (optional)
#
# The fragment length value is only required for single-end data and
# can also be specified via a 'fragment_length_value' Sample annotation key.
#
# fragment_length_value =

# Fragment Length Standard Deviation (optional)
#
# The fragment length standard deviation is only required for single-end data and
# can also be specified via a 'fragment_length_standard_deviation' Sample annotation key.
#
# fragment_length_standard_deviation =

# Sequence-specific bias correction (optional)
#
# Learn parameters for a model of sequence-specific bias and correct transcript abundances.
#
# bias_correction = true

# Bootstrap Samples (optional)
#
# The number of bootstrap samples.
